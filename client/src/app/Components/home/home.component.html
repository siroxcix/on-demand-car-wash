      <h2 class="text-center text-success">About Me</h2>
      <p><strong>Green Car Wash </strong> is unique in that we are a “Flex” service car wash. What that means to you is that we are the only car wash you will ever need. At Green car wash, our approach combines the latest car wash technology with the human touch to provide the best car wash experience possible.

        <li><b>What you need when you need it</b> Choose from a wide range of packages.All done expertly and with the highest quality soaps and waxes.</li> 
        
        <li>We believe in making customer satisfaction a top priority. We are vehicle owners just like you and we understand that it can be a stressful experience to trust your vehicle with someone else. At Wetzone, you can rest assured that we will treat your vehicle as if it was our own. We wash one vehicle at a time, so we can make sure each vehicle receives the best treatment possible.</li>
        
        <li><b>Amenities</b> We know you are busy, so we strive to provide you with a comfortable and productive space while you wait. All our locations have comfortable lobbies and outside seating areas with free Wi-Fi access, free popcorn and free premium coffee. We also vend snacks, drinks and car care products for your convenience.</li>
        <li><strong>Every aspect of our wash process has been carefully designed to deliver a clean, shiny, dry car.</strong></li>
        
        
        <li><strong>Foam Zone</strong> – This is where the cleaning happens. As you enter our wash tunnel, we apply presoak and soap with different Ph levels, designed to loosen and remove the dirt. We then use our state of the art Soft Touch safe equipment to complete the cleaning process.</li> 
        <li><strong>Shine Zone</strong> – This is where the magic happens, only after your car has been thoroughly clean do we add any wax products. We offer Simoniz Triple Foam Polish, Simoniz Carnuba Hot Wax & Shine, and Simoniz Sealer Wax. These products can be combined to deliver maximum shine to your vehicle.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect Zone</strong> – Harmful UV rays and rain can eventually harm the delicate clear coat on your vehicle’s surface. Protect Zone offers the right products to help you prolong the life of your paint. Once the proper wax products have been applied, you can choose Simoniz Clear Coat Protectant to seal the paint surface and add UV protection. You can also add Rain X Complete, which provides protection from rain, by helping the beading process and allowing water to run off your vehicle, and your windshield.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish Zone</strong> – The final phase of the wash process is rinsing and drying. We use the latest reverse-osmosis process to remove minerals and impurities from the water, to create spot-free rinse. We apply this rinse as the final step, to remove soap residue and deliver a spotless car. We then dry the car with our sonar driven dryer system that follows the contour of your car to insure the most efficient drying process. The result, a clean, shiny dry car.</li>
